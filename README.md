Version control (also known as revision control, source control, and source code management) is the software engineering practice of controlling computer files and versions of files; primarily source code text files, but generally any type of file.
Version control is a component of software configuration management.
A version control system is a software tool that automates version control. Alternatively, version control is embedded as a feature of some systems such as word processors, spreadsheets, collaborative web docs, and content management systems, e.g., Wikipedia's page history.
Version control includes viewing old versions and enables reverting a file to a previous version.
